âœ“ Correct
Feedback:
The abstract class A contains two abstract methods and one public method. Class B extends the class and defines the abstract methodB() but does not override methodA or methodC. While it is okay to not override a method that is already defined in the abstract, it is mandatory to define/override an abstract method at least once in the code if there is any subclass of the abstract class. In this code, the abstract class A is inherited only by class B but B does not contain any definition for the abstract methodA. Therefore, the code throws a compilation error.
