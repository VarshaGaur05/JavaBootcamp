âœ“ Correct
Feedback:
In this code, both the class Base and the interface BaseInterface consist of the display() method which is called by the object of the class Source. When a class and an interface contain a method having the same signature, then the preference is given to the definition declared in the class and the definition mentioned in the interface is discarded.
